# OpenClaw Review Policy

## Decision hierarchy

1. Safety boundaries
2. Required files
3. Metadata consistency
4. Scenario quality
5. Source and license clarity
6. Release asset safety if downloads are involved
7. Human review readiness

## Status rules

### `needs_fixes`

Use when required files, metadata or examples are incomplete.

### `needs_sources`

Use when claims rely on missing, unclear or invented sources.

### `needs_trust_review`

Use when `data_risk` is `yellow` or `red`, or when sensitive domains are involved.

### `ready_for_human_eval`

Use only when the contribution appears structurally complete and safe enough for human review.

### `post_mvp_recommended`

Use for high-risk or complex contributions that should not block `v0.1-rc`.

## Release asset rule

If a contribution references large files, check whether asset metadata is present:

- file name
- version
- size
- checksum
- source status
- license status
- data risk
- human review status

Missing asset metadata means `needs_fixes` or `needs_trust_review`.

## Never do

- Never approve final status.
- Never merge.
- Never publish.
- Never override human review.
- Never claim legal, audit or compliance approval.
